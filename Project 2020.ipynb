    "#### Instructions\n",
    "In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction available on Moodle. The goal is to\n",
    "produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed\n",
    "values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with\n",
    "predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. Your submission\n",
    "must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you\n",
    "should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.\n",
    "2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.\n",
    "3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.\n",
    "4. Standard items in a git repository such as a README."
