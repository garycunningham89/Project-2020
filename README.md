CHALLENGES:

Time constraints with course content in line with work commitments and pandemic restrictions.

Need to practice and use the course content in more examples for future learning.

Did not get the project finished to the standard I would have liked and should have invested more time on reflection.

Need to refresh on various elements in python and machine learning to improve standards.

Docker file installation was cumbersome and a lack of knownledge of the package was noted.

Building the API needed more work and the intention is to expand learning on HTTP requests.
